# NIST 800-53 Controls Implemented by Kubernetes Policy Engines

This document maps the Kubernetes policies implemented in this scenario to specific NIST 800-53 controls required for FedRAMP compliance.

## NIST 800-53 Control Families

For FedRAMP, the following NIST 800-53 control families are particularly relevant to Kubernetes policy engines:

| Control Family | ID | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| Access Control | AC | Limiting system access to authorized users and processes |
| Configuration Management | CM | Baseline configuration and inventory of system components |
| System and Information Integrity | SI | Protection against malicious code and security alerts |
| System and Communications Protection | SC | Boundary protection and resource management |

## Policy to NIST Control Mapping

### OPA Gatekeeper Policies

| Policy | NIST Control | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| K8sRequiredLabels | CM-8 | Information System Component Inventory. Requires proper labeling of all resources to maintain an accurate inventory of Kubernetes components. |
| K8sBlockPrivilegedContainers | AC-6 | Least Privilege. Prevents containers from running with privileged access, enforcing the principle of least privilege. |
| K8sAllowedRepos | CM-7 | Least Functionality. Restricts image sources to trusted repositories, implementing the principle of least functionality. |
| K8sRequiredResources | SC-6 | Resource Availability. Enforces resource limits to protect against resource exhaustion attacks. |

### Kyverno Policies

| Policy | NIST Control | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| require-security-labels | CM-8 | Information System Component Inventory. Ensures proper labeling of all resources to maintain an accurate inventory of Kubernetes components. |
| restrict-privileged-containers | AC-6 | Least Privilege. Prevents containers from running with privileged access, enforcing the principle of least privilege. |
| allowed-image-registries | CM-7 | Least Functionality. Restricts image sources to trusted repositories, implementing the principle of least functionality. |
| require-resource-limits | SC-6 | Resource Availability. Enforces resource limits to protect against resource exhaustion attacks. |
| disallow-host-namespaces | SC-7 | Boundary Protection. Prevents pods from accessing host namespaces, maintaining proper boundaries between resources. |
| disallow-capabilities | AC-6 | Least Privilege. Blocks containers from obtaining dangerous Linux capabilities, enforcing the principle of least privilege. |

## Detailed Control Mappings

### CM-8: Information System Component Inventory

**Required FedRAMP Control:** Organizations must develop and document an inventory of system components that accurately reflects the current system, is consistent with the authorization boundary, is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting, and includes information deemed necessary to achieve effective system component accountability.

**Implementation in Policy Engines:**
- OPA Gatekeeper's K8sRequiredLabels ensures that all resources have required labels for inventory tracking.
- Kyverno's require-security-labels implements similar requirements using native YAML.
- Together, these policies ensure that all Kubernetes resources have the necessary metadata for proper inventory tracking and management.

### AC-6: Least Privilege

**Required FedRAMP Control:** Organizations must employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users and processes which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks.

**Implementation in Policy Engines:**
- OPA Gatekeeper's K8sBlockPrivilegedContainers prevents containers from running with heightened privileges.
- Kyverno's restrict-privileged-containers implements the same control using pattern matching.
- Kyverno's disallow-capabilities provides additional protection by preventing containers from obtaining dangerous Linux capabilities.
- Together, these policies enforce least privilege at multiple levels within the Kubernetes environment.

### CM-7: Least Functionality

**Required FedRAMP Control:** Organizations must configure the system to provide only essential capabilities and prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and services as defined in the security plan.

**Implementation in Policy Engines:**
- OPA Gatekeeper's K8sAllowedRepos restricts the sources of container images to trusted repositories.
- Kyverno's allowed-image-registries implements similar restrictions using regex pattern matching.
- Together, these policies ensure that only approved, trusted code can be deployed into the Kubernetes environment.

### SC-6: Resource Availability

**Required FedRAMP Control:** Organizations must protect the availability of resources by allocating processor and memory resources by priority and resource sharing.

**Implementation in Policy Engines:**
- OPA Gatekeeper's K8sRequiredResources ensures that all containers specify resource limits.
- Kyverno's require-resource-limits implements the same control using pattern matching.
- Together, these policies prevent resource exhaustion attacks and ensure fair resource allocation.

### SC-7: Boundary Protection

**Required FedRAMP Control:** Organizations must monitor and control communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system.

**Implementation in Policy Engines:**
- Kyverno's disallow-host-namespaces prevents pods from accessing host namespaces (network, PID, IPC).
- This policy helps maintain proper boundaries between containers and the host system, limiting attack pathways.

## FedRAMP Documentation Evidence

When compiling evidence for FedRAMP authorization, you can use this mapping to demonstrate how your Kubernetes policy implementations satisfy specific NIST 800-53 controls. The following artifacts should be included:

1. This mapping document
2. Export of all policies from the cluster
3. Policy audit results showing enforcement and compliance
4. Documentation of the policy implementation process
5. Policy exemption process (if any) and justifications

You should update this document whenever policies are added, modified, or removed from your Kubernetes environment.
