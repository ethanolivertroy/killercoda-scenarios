# Kubernetes Policy Enforcement for FedRAMP Compliance

## Introduction

In the context of FedRAMP compliance, Kubernetes environments must implement numerous security controls defined in NIST 800-53. Policy enforcement provides a powerful way to automate these controls through "policy as code" - defining security requirements as code that is automatically enforced.

This scenario focuses on lightweight policy enforcement mechanisms:

1. **ValidatingAdmissionPolicy**: A Kubernetes native feature that uses Common Expression Language (CEL) for policy validation
2. **Minimal Kyverno**: A resource-optimized deployment of Kyverno, a Kubernetes-native policy engine

Both approaches integrate with Kubernetes admission control to enforce policies at the time of resource creation or modification, implementing preventative controls with minimal resource overhead.

## Environment Preparation

Before we begin, let's ensure our environment is ready:

```
# Increase available memory on worker node
ssh node01 "echo '3' > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
```{{exec}}

This command helps free up memory on the worker node, which can prevent resource-related issues during the scenario.

> **Note:** If at any point you experience resource issues, you can run the provided cleanup helper script:
> ```
> bash /root/cleanup-helper.sh
> ```
> This script will attempt to free up memory and clean up resources to help stabilize the environment.

## FedRAMP Relevance

Policy enforcement helps implement several key FedRAMP control families:

- **Access Control (AC)**: Enforce least privilege and separation of duties
- **Configuration Management (CM)**: Ensure baseline configurations are maintained
- **System and Information Integrity (SI)**: Prevent unauthorized code execution
- **System and Communications Protection (SC)**: Enforce boundary protection

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this scenario, you will be able to:

1. Use Kubernetes ValidatingAdmissionPolicies to implement FedRAMP security controls
2. Understand how CEL expressions can define policy validation rules
3. Install and configure a minimal Kyverno deployment to optimize resource usage
4. Implement lightweight policies for enforcing FedRAMP controls
5. Audit policy enforcement and generate documentation for FedRAMP compliance evidence 
6. Compare the different approaches and understand their resource efficiency

Let's begin by implementing ValidatingAdmissionPolicies for key FedRAMP controls!
