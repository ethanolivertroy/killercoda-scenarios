# Kubernetes Policy Engines for FedRAMP Compliance

## Introduction

In the context of FedRAMP compliance, Kubernetes environments must implement numerous security controls defined in NIST 800-53. Policy engines provide a powerful way to enforce these controls systematically through "policy as code" - defining security requirements as code that is automatically enforced.

This scenario focuses on two leading Kubernetes policy engines:

1. **OPA Gatekeeper**: An extensible policy engine that uses the Rego language for defining constraints
2. **Kyverno**: A Kubernetes-native policy engine that uses YAML for defining policies

Both tools integrate with Kubernetes admission controllers to enforce policies at the time of resource creation or modification, implementing preventative controls that ensure resources cannot be deployed unless they meet security requirements.

## Environment Preparation

Before we begin, let's ensure our environment is ready:

```
# Increase available memory on worker node
ssh node01 "echo '3' > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
```{{exec}}

This command helps free up memory on the worker node, which can prevent resource-related issues when installing our policy engines.

> **Note:** If at any point you experience resource issues (like ImagePullBackOff errors), you can run the provided cleanup helper script:
> ```
> bash /root/cleanup-helper.sh
> ```
> This script will attempt to free up memory and clean up resources to help stabilize the environment.

## FedRAMP Relevance

Policy engines help implement several key FedRAMP control families:

- **Access Control (AC)**: Enforce least privilege and separation of duties
- **Configuration Management (CM)**: Ensure baseline configurations are maintained
- **System and Information Integrity (SI)**: Prevent unauthorized code execution
- **System and Communications Protection (SC)**: Enforce boundary protection

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this scenario, you will be able to:

1. Install and configure OPA Gatekeeper in a Kubernetes cluster
2. Implement policies that enforce FedRAMP security controls using Gatekeeper constraints
3. Install and configure Kyverno in a Kubernetes cluster
4. Implement equivalent policies using Kyverno's YAML-based approach
5. Audit policy enforcement and generate documentation for FedRAMP compliance evidence
6. Compare the two approaches and understand their relative strengths

Let's begin by setting up OPA Gatekeeper and implementing our first set of policies!
