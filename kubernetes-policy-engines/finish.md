# Congratulations!

You've successfully completed the **Kubernetes Policy Engines for FedRAMP Compliance** scenario. Let's review what you've learned:

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Implemented OPA Gatekeeper Policies**
   - Installed and configured OPA Gatekeeper
   - Created constraint templates for key FedRAMP controls
   - Applied constraints to enforce security requirements

2. **Implemented Kyverno Policies**
   - Installed and configured Kyverno
   - Created policies that implement the same FedRAMP controls
   - Compared the two approaches and understood their relative strengths

3. **Audited and Documented Policy Compliance**
   - Mapped policies to specific FedRAMP controls
   - Generated compliance documentation for FedRAMP authorization
   - Created tools for continuous monitoring

## FedRAMP Controls Implemented

Through policy engines, you've implemented controls from key FedRAMP control families:

- **Access Control (AC)**: Enforced least privilege principles
- **Configuration Management (CM)**: Ensured proper component inventory and least functionality
- **System and Communications Protection (SC)**: Protected resource availability
- **System and Information Integrity (SI)**: Prevented unauthorized code execution

## Next Steps

To further enhance your FedRAMP compliance using Kubernetes policy engines:

1. **Expand Policy Coverage**: Implement additional policies for other FedRAMP controls
2. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Test policy compliance in your CI/CD pipeline
3. **Implement Automated Reporting**: Create regular reports of policy compliance status
4. **Explore Advanced Features**: Use mutation policies to automatically remediate issues
5. **Implement Exception Handling**: Define processes for handling legitimate policy exceptions

## Additional Resources

- [NIST Special Publication 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)
- [OPA Gatekeeper Documentation](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/)
- [Kyverno Documentation](https://kyverno.io/docs/)
- [FedRAMP Documentation](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/)

By using policy engines to enforce security controls, you've implemented a key component of a secure Kubernetes platform that can help achieve and maintain FedRAMP compliance. These preventative controls provide continuous assurance that your system meets security requirements.
