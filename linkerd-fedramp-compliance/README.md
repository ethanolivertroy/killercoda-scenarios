# Linkerd Service Mesh Security for FedRAMP Compliance

This Killercoda scenario teaches how to implement and assess Linkerd service mesh security controls for FedRAMP compliance based on NIST guidance.

## Workshop Overview

In this interactive workshop, participants will learn how to:

1. Set up a compliant Linkerd service mesh with secure configuration
2. Implement mTLS and authentication controls
3. Configure authorization policies based on service identity
4. Audit service mesh security configuration for FedRAMP compliance
5. Generate compliance documentation and evidence
