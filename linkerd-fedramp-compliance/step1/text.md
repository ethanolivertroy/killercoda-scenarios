# Installing and Configuring a Secure Linkerd Mesh

In this step, we'll install Linkerd with security-focused configurations that align with FedRAMP requirements. Linkerd's security architecture is designed with a zero-trust approach, providing strong defaults that map to several NIST 800-53 controls.

## Background: Linkerd Security Architecture

Linkerd's security model centers on:

1. **Strong Service Identity**: Every service gets a cryptographic identity (SPIFFE-compatible)
2. **Automatic mTLS**: All inter-service communications are automatically encrypted
3. **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate rotation and validation
4. **Policy Enforcement**: Fine-grained access control between services

These capabilities map directly to FedRAMP requirements including:
- **SC-8/SC-13**: Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity
- **IA-3**: Device Identification and Authentication
- **AC-17**: Remote Access

## Task 1: Install the Linkerd CLI

First, let's download and install the Linkerd CLI which we'll use to manage our service mesh:

```bash
# Download and install the Linkerd CLI
curl -sL https://run.linkerd.io/install | sh

# Add linkerd to your path
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.linkerd2/bin

# Verify the CLI is installed correctly
linkerd version
```{{exec}}

## Task 2: Verify Kubernetes Cluster Readiness

Before installing Linkerd, let's check if our Kubernetes cluster is properly configured:

```bash
# Run pre-checks to verify cluster configuration
linkerd check --pre
```{{exec}}

This command ensures your Kubernetes cluster meets all the requirements for a Linkerd installation.

## Task 3: Install Linkerd with FedRAMP-Compliant Configuration

Now, let's install Linkerd with enhanced security settings that align with FedRAMP requirements:

```bash
# Install Gateway API CRDs first
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml

# Now install the Linkerd CRDs
linkerd install --crds | kubectl apply -f -

# Install the Linkerd control plane with basic settings
linkerd install | kubectl apply -f -

# Wait for Linkerd to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod --all -n linkerd --timeout=300s
```{{exec}}

## Task 4: Verify Installation Security

Let's verify that Linkerd has been installed securely:

```bash
# Run linkerd check to ensure everything is working correctly
linkerd check

# Verify that mTLS is configured correctly
linkerd check --proxy

# Ensure all Linkerd components are running
kubectl get pods -n linkerd
```{{exec}}

## Task 5: Understand Linkerd's Security Components

Linkerd's security architecture consists of several components that work together to provide a secure service mesh:

```bash
# View the Linkerd identity components
kubectl get deployments -n linkerd | grep identity

# Check the certificate authority setup
kubectl get secret linkerd-identity-issuer -n linkerd -o yaml

# Examine the Linkerd proxy injector
kubectl get deployment linkerd-proxy-injector -n linkerd -o yaml | grep -A20 containers:
```{{exec}}

## FedRAMP Compliance Check

Let's evaluate how our Linkerd installation satisfies key FedRAMP requirements:

1. **SC-8 (Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity)**:
   - Linkerd automatically enables mTLS between all meshed services
   - TLS certificates are short-lived and automatically rotated

2. **IA-3 (Device Identification and Authentication)**:
   - Each service gets a unique SPIFFE identity
   - Identity is cryptographically verifiable

3. **AC-17 (Remote Access)**:
   - All service-to-service access is authenticated and encrypted
   - Policy controller enables granular access control

4. **AU-2/AU-3 (Audit Events/Content of Audit Records)**:
   - Detailed proxy logs capture all service-to-service communication
   - Metrics provide visibility into access patterns

In the next step, we'll deploy applications to the mesh and implement security policies to further enhance our FedRAMP compliance posture.
