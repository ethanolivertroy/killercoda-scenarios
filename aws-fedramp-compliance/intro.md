# AWS FedRAMP Compliance Assessment with LocalStack

## Introduction

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services used by the US government. Organizations seeking to provide cloud services to federal agencies must adhere to FedRAMP requirements, which are based on NIST 800-53 security controls.

In this scenario, you will:

1. Set up LocalStack, a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your local machine
2. Deploy sample AWS resources that represent common cloud architecture patterns
3. Evaluate these resources against key FedRAMP controls
4. Generate compliance reports that identify gaps and remediation steps

## Environment Preparation

We'll be using LocalStack Community Edition to emulate AWS services. This allows us to test and evaluate compliance controls in a controlled environment without accessing actual AWS resources or incurring costs.

Let's ensure our environment is ready:

```
# Run environment setup script
bash /root/setup.sh
```{{exec}}

This script will:
- Install Docker (required for LocalStack)
- Install AWS CLI and configure it to work with LocalStack 
- Set up environment variables for easier AWS CLI usage
- Install necessary Python dependencies
- Start LocalStack container
- Install utility tools for compliance assessment

> **Note:** For simplicity, we've configured the AWS CLI to automatically use the LocalStack endpoint. This allows us to use standard AWS CLI commands without having to specify the `--endpoint-url` parameter each time.

## FedRAMP Relevance

AWS environments must implement numerous security controls to achieve FedRAMP compliance. This training focuses on key control families:

- **Access Control (AC)**: Identity and access management configurations
- **Audit and Accountability (AU)**: Logging and monitoring settings
- **Configuration Management (CM)**: Resource configurations and standards
- **System and Communications Protection (SC)**: Network security and encryption

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this scenario, you will be able to:

1. Set up and configure a simulated AWS environment for testing
2. Deploy AWS resources following compliance best practices
3. Evaluate IAM configurations against FedRAMP requirements
4. Assess CloudTrail and logging settings for audit compliance
5. Check S3 bucket configurations for secure data storage
6. Generate compliance reports that map findings to FedRAMP controls

Let's begin by setting up our LocalStack environment and deploying our AWS resources!
